# Content Security Policy (CSP)

The **Content Security Policy (CSP)** is a crucial security feature that helps protect your web application from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and data exfiltration. By defining a set of rules and directives, CSP instructs browsers on which sources of content are permitted to be loaded and executed on a web page.

## Why Use CSP?

CSP serves as a powerful defense mechanism against various web-based attacks, including:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks:** CSP helps prevent the injection of malicious scripts into your web pages.

- **Data Exfiltration:** It mitigates the risk of sensitive data leakage from your web application.

## Configuring CSP

CSP policies are defined using a series of directives in the web page's HTTP response headers or within HTML `<meta>` tags. Here are some commonly used directives:

### `default-src`

This directive sets the default source for loading content such as JavaScript, Images, CSS, Fonts, etc. when other directives are not specified. It's a fallback for other CSP directives.

Example:

default-src 'self' foo.com;

### `script-src`

Controls which scripts can be executed. This is particularly important for preventing XSS attacks.

script-src 'self' js.foo.com

### `style-src`

Specifies the sources from which stylesheets can be loaded.

Example:

style-src 'self' https://foo.com;

### `connect-src`

Determines the allowed sources for network requests, such as XMLHttpRequest, Fetch, or WebSocket.

Example:

connect-src 'self' https://api.example.com;

### `frame-src`

Controls the sources that can embed your web page in a `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, or `<embed>`.

Example:

frame-src 'self' https://trustedframe.com;

### `report-uri` and `report-to`

These directives allow you to specify a URL where the browser sends violation reports when a CSP policy is violated. This directive is deprecated in CSP Level 3 in favor of the report-to directive.

Example:

report-uri /csp-report-endpoint;


## Practical Implementation

To implement CSP for your web application, follow these steps:

1. Identify the trusted sources for your content, such as your own domain and trusted third-party domains.

2. Craft a CSP policy that includes the appropriate directives to allow content from these trusted sources and block content from untrusted sources.

3. Set the CSP policy in the HTTP response headers of your web server or within HTML `<meta>` tags in your web pages.

4. Continuously monitor and refine your CSP policy based on your application's needs and security requirements.

Remember that while CSP is a powerful security tool, it requires careful planning and testing to ensure it doesn't inadvertently block legitimate content on your website. Regularly review and update your CSP policy to maintain a strong defense against web-based attacks.
